How to allow your users to pay products with paypal:

1.) In your shop configuration, set: 

'payPalMethod' => X 

where X is the id of the payment method that defines paypal.

Now, the user gets directed to the paypal URL by the Paypal IPN System.

If the payment succeds, it will set the status of the order from
'new' to 'in progress' automatically.
